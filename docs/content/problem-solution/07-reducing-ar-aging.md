## What Causes AR Aging in Law Firms?

Accounts receivable aging in law firms stems from three primary factors: delayed billing processes, inconsistent client communication, and inadequate follow-up systems. According to Thomson Reuters, the average law firm collection rate hovers around 86%, meaning 14% of billed work goes uncollected. For mid-size firms (10-150 attorneys), this translates to substantial revenue leakage that directly impacts profitability and cash flow.

The billing delay cycle begins when attorneys postpone time entry, creating a backlog that billing staff struggle to clear. This delay compounds when month-end creates a billing crunch, resulting in invoices sent weeks after work completion. By that time, clients have moved on mentally, making payment discussions more difficult. The longer invoices sit, the less likely they are to be paid in full.

Beyond Square One has worked with mid-size law firms for over 30 years, and we consistently see the same AR aging patterns. Firms with AR aging over 90 days exceeding 20% of total receivables face predictable cash flow challenges. One insurance defense firm we partner with reduced their 90+ day AR from 28% to 11% within six months by implementing systematic process improvements.

## How Long Should Law Firm AR Aging Take?

Best-in-class law firms maintain 90+ day AR aging below 10% of total receivables. The benchmark progression looks like this:

- **0-30 days:** 65-75% of total AR
- **31-60 days:** 15-20% of total AR
- **61-90 days:** 8-12% of total AR
- **90+ days:** Less than 10% of total AR

Firms exceeding these thresholds experience cash flow constraints that limit growth opportunities and create operational stress. The goal is not zero AR aging—clients need reasonable payment terms—but rather predictable collection patterns that support financial planning.

Industry data from the Legal Trends Report indicates that firms collecting payment within 30 days of invoice date achieve 95% collection rates, compared to 78% for firms waiting beyond 60 days. This 17-percentage-point difference represents significant revenue impact for mid-size firms billing $5-50 million annually.

## What Are the Best Practices for Reducing AR Aging?

Effective AR aging reduction requires systematic approaches across billing operations, client communication, and technology utilization. The highest-impact practices include:

### 1. Accelerate Time Entry to Billing Cycle

The most effective AR reduction strategy is reducing the time between work completion and invoice delivery. Firms should target 5-7 days from month-end to invoice delivery. This requires:

- **Daily time entry discipline:** Attorneys record time same-day or next-day
- **Pre-bill review scheduling:** Partners review pre-bills by the 3rd business day of each month
- **Automated invoice generation:** Billing software produces final invoices by the 5th business day
- **Immediate invoice delivery:** Clients receive invoices by the 7th business day

Beyond Square One partners with firms to implement this accelerated cycle using Tabs3 billing optimization. Our billing specialists maintain daily time entry monitoring, ensuring nothing slips through month-end cracks. One litigation firm reduced their billing cycle from 18 days to 6 days, resulting in a 23% improvement in 30-day collection rates.

### 2. Implement Tiered Follow-Up Systems

Consistent follow-up transforms AR aging from passive waiting to active management. Effective systems include:

- **Day 1:** Invoice delivery with clear payment terms
- **Day 15:** Courtesy payment reminder for unpaid invoices
- **Day 35:** Direct phone call to accounts payable contact
- **Day 50:** Partner-level communication regarding payment status
- **Day 65:** Formal collection notice with payment plan options
- **Day 90:** Decision point for external collection or write-off

The key is consistency. Manual follow-up systems fail because billing staff juggle competing priorities. Automated reminder systems built into practice management software ensure no invoice goes unattended. However, automation works best when paired with human judgment—some clients require personalized communication rather than automated reminders.

### 3. Segment Clients by Payment Behavior

Not all clients deserve identical treatment. Smart AR management segments clients into payment profiles:

- **Prompt Payers (0-15 days):** Minimal intervention, acknowledgment of payment habits
- **Standard Payers (16-45 days):** Normal follow-up procedures
- **Slow Payers (46-75 days):** Enhanced communication, potential payment plan discussions
- **Problem Accounts (76+ days):** Partner involvement, alternative arrangements

This segmentation allows billing staff to allocate attention appropriately. Prompt payers receive appreciation and continued relationship building. Problem accounts receive intensive management before balances become uncollectible.

One commercial litigation firm we work with implemented client segmentation and reduced overall AR aging by 19% within one quarter. They discovered that 12% of clients accounted for 67% of aged receivables, allowing targeted intervention rather than blanket policies.

### 4. Leverage Technology for AR Management

Practice management software like Tabs3 provides powerful AR aging tools when properly configured:

- **Automated aging reports:** Weekly AR aging by client, matter, and responsible attorney
- **Payment trend analysis:** Historical payment patterns predicting future behavior
- **Client communication tracking:** Documentation of all collection efforts
- **Customizable workflows:** Automated reminders based on client payment profiles

Beyond Square One specializes in Tabs3 optimization as a President's Circle partner. We configure AR aging reports that surface problems before they become crises. Our clients receive weekly AR dashboards highlighting accounts requiring attention, with specific recommended actions based on payment history.

Technology alone does not solve AR aging. Technology combined with systematic processes and skilled billing professionals creates sustainable improvement.

## How Do You Communicate With Clients About Aged Receivables?

Client communication about aged receivables requires professionalism, empathy, and firmness. The conversation approach should match the relationship stage:

### Initial Conversations (30-45 Days)

Begin with assumption of oversight rather than unwillingness to pay:

"I'm reaching out regarding invoice #12345 from [date]. I wanted to ensure you received it and see if you have any questions about the charges. Our records show the payment is still outstanding, and I wanted to check in personally."

This approach preserves the relationship while establishing payment expectation. Many aged receivables result from administrative oversights—invoices sent to wrong contacts, lost in email systems, or awaiting internal approval processes.

### Follow-Up Conversations (46-75 Days)

Escalate urgency while offering solutions:

"We've attempted to reach you several times regarding invoice #12345, now 60 days past due. We value our relationship and want to understand if there are concerns about the charges or if you're experiencing payment timing challenges. We're happy to discuss payment plan options or address any billing questions."

This stage introduces consequences (recognition of repeated attempts) while maintaining partnership tone. Payment plans often emerge from these conversations, converting potentially uncollectible balances into structured payment streams.

### Serious Conversations (76+ Days)

Involve partners and establish clear expectations:

"I need to discuss invoice #12345, now 90 days past due. As we've discussed previously, this balance requires immediate attention. We need to establish a payment plan this week or discuss alternative arrangements. Without resolution, we'll need to pause additional work on your matters."

Clear boundaries protect the firm while giving clients final opportunity for resolution. The threat to pause work (or actually pausing work) often produces payment when softer approaches fail.

## What Role Does Billing Staff Training Play in AR Reduction?

Skilled billing professionals are force multipliers for AR reduction. Beyond Square One has maintained 10-20 year relationships with client firms precisely because our billing specialists bring expertise that most firms cannot build internally.

Effective billing staff understand:

- **Client psychology:** When to push, when to show flexibility, when to escalate
- **Legal industry norms:** Standard payment practices by practice area and client type
- **Technology capabilities:** Full utilization of practice management software features
- **Process optimization:** Identifying bottlenecks and implementing improvements

The staffing challenge for mid-size firms is significant. Hiring experienced legal billing professionals is expensive and competitive. Training new billing staff takes 6-12 months before they operate independently. Staff turnover creates knowledge loss and process disruption.

The embedded partnership model addresses this challenge. Beyond Square One billing specialists work as extensions of client firms, bringing deep expertise without hiring headcount. Our team members average 15+ years of legal billing experience, with specific Tabs3 expertise refined across dozens of firm implementations.

When billing staff turnover occurs, firms working with us experience seamless continuity because multiple team members know their systems and processes. One insurance defense firm experienced zero disruption when their in-house billing manager departed because our team maintained operational continuity throughout the transition.

## How Quickly Can Law Firms Improve AR Aging?

Meaningful AR aging improvement typically requires 90-180 days, with visible progress within the first 30-60 days. The timeline depends on:

- **Current AR composition:** Firms with significant 120+ day aging require longer recovery periods
- **Process discipline:** Consistent execution of new workflows determines speed of improvement
- **Client base composition:** Corporate clients respond faster than individual clients
- **Technology readiness:** Firms with modern practice management software improve faster

Beyond Square One typically sees this improvement trajectory:

- **Month 1:** Process assessment, workflow optimization, staff training
- **Month 2:** Initial improvements in current month billing, aging stabilization
- **Month 3:** Visible reduction in 60-90 day aging, improved collection rates
- **Months 4-6:** Substantial improvement in 90+ day aging, sustainable process establishment

One mid-size litigation firm we partnered with achieved these results over six months:

- **90+ day AR:** Reduced from 24% to 11% of total receivables
- **Average collection time:** Improved from 67 days to 41 days
- **Overall collection rate:** Increased from 84% to 91%
- **Cash flow improvement:** Generated $4 million in accelerated collections

These improvements resulted not from one-time collection efforts but from systematic process changes that created sustainable results. The firm maintains these improved metrics three years later because the underlying operational capabilities support ongoing performance.
