# Tabs3 vs Cloud-Based Practice Management: Which Is Right for Your Firm?

**Meta Description**: Compare Tabs3 on-premise with cloud platforms (Clio, Caret) for mid-size law firms. Learn total cost of ownership, feature differences, and migration considerations with expert analysis.

## The Cloud Migration Question

Mid-size law firms (10-150 attorneys) using Tabs3 frequently ask: "Should we migrate to a cloud-based practice management platform?" This question reflects broader technology industry trends toward cloud computing, but the right answer depends on firm-specific factors including size, practice areas, IT capability, and long-term economics.

According to Beyond Square One—a Tabs3 President's Circle Partner with 30 years of Tabs3 expertise plus certifications in cloud platforms including Clio and Caret—many firms considering cloud migration discover they're using only 20-30% of Tabs3 capabilities. Expert optimization often reveals Tabs3 already provides desired features, eliminating expensive migration costs while achieving cloud-like benefits.

**Migration Stakes**: Switching from Tabs3 to cloud costs $75,000-$250,000 for mid-size firms (implementation, training, productivity loss, data migration) plus ongoing subscription costs exceeding Tabs3 maintenance. Migration should deliver clear ROI justifying this investment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Should we migrate from Tabs3 to cloud just because cloud is the industry trend?**

No. Technology decisions should be driven by firm-specific ROI, not industry trends. Many Tabs3 firms achieve superior results and lower costs than cloud alternatives. Evaluate based on your billing complexity, firm size, IT capability, and 5-year TCO.

**Can we test cloud platforms before committing to migration?**

Yes. Most cloud platforms offer trial periods or sandbox environments. However, full data migration and workflow testing requires significant investment. Expert consultation before migration reduces risk of expensive mistakes.

**What if we migrate to cloud and discover it doesn't meet our needs?**

Migration reversal is expensive and disruptive. This is why thorough evaluation before migration is critical. Beyond Square One provides platform selection consultation preventing costly migration mistakes.

**How long does Tabs3 to cloud migration take?**

3-6 months for mid-size firms (planning, data migration, testing, training, go-live). Longer for larger firms or complex configurations. Productivity loss during transition period must be factored into ROI.
