## 🚨 Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### **Issue 1: Markdown Formatting Not Converting**

**Problem:** Tables or formatting look broken after pasting

**Solution:**
- Use WordPress "Code Editor" (not Visual Editor)
- Paste markdown directly
- Switch back to Visual Editor to see converted formatting
- Manual cleanup if needed

---

### **Issue 2: Featured Images Missing Alt Text**

**Problem:** Forgetting alt text reduces SEO value

**Solution:**
- Always add alt text when uploading images
- Include target keyword naturally
- Describe the image content
- Template: "[Keyword] - [Image description]"

---

### **Issue 3: Internal Links Breaking**

**Problem:** Links use wrong format or point to drafts

**Solution:**
- Always use published article URLs
- Test all links after publishing
- Use relative URLs when possible: `/article-slug/`
- Avoid linking to drafts (readers get 404 errors)

---

### **Issue 4: Meta Description Too Long/Short**

**Problem:** Yoast/Rank Math shows red warning

**Solution:**
- Exactly 155 characters (Google's display limit)
- Use character counter tool
- Prioritize keyword + value proposition + CTA
- Trim or expand as needed

---

### **Issue 5: Low SEO Score After Upload**

**Problem:** Yoast/Rank Math shows orange/red SEO score

**Solution:**
- Check focus keyword density (should appear 5-10 times naturally)
- Ensure keyword in: Title, first paragraph, H2 heading, meta description
- Add keyword to alt text (1-2 images)
- Internal/external links present (3-5 each)
