### **Task 5: Identify Your Preferences** (15 minutes)

**Before the checkpoint**, think through these questions so you can make decisions:

**Question 1: Publishing Timeline**
- [ ] **Option A**: Upload all 20 articles this week (recommended if site is new/low-traffic)
- [ ] **Option B**: Publish 1 per day over 4 weeks (for SEO pacing)
- [ ] **Option C**: Not sure - need to discuss

**Question 2: WordPress Implementation**
- [ ] **Option A**: I'll handle WordPress upload myself
- [ ] **Option B**: I need step-by-step guidance from Claude
- [ ] **Option C**: I want to hire someone to do WordPress upload
- [ ] **Option D**: Not sure - need to discuss

**Question 3: First Priority After Publishing**
- [ ] **Option A**: Technical SEO setup (schema markup, Google Search Console)
- [ ] **Option B**: AI search optimization (monitor citations, refine content)
- [ ] **Option C**: Promotion (email newsletter, LinkedIn, partner outreach)
- [ ] **Option D**: All equally important - need to discuss

**Question 4: Resource Allocation**
- [ ] I'll handle all WordPress and SEO work myself
- [ ] I'll hire a WordPress/SEO contractor
- [ ] I'll use Claude Code to guide me through each step
- [ ] Not sure - need to discuss

**Why**: Having preferences (even tentative) helps the checkpoint be productive.

---

### **Task 7: Upload First Test Article** (45 minutes)

**Choose One Article to Start**:
- **Recommended**: `category-creation/01-what-is-legal-billing-partnership.md`
- **Why**: It's the foundational article and relatively straightforward

**Step-by-Step Process**:

**Step 1: Convert Markdown to WordPress** (15 min)

1. Open the file: `/Users/adamsandler/projects/BSO/marketing-team-base/content/blog-posts/category-creation/01-what-is-legal-billing-partnership.md`

2. Copy everything AFTER the meta description line (starts with "## What Is...")

3. In WordPress, go to: Posts → Add New

4. Paste the content into the WordPress editor

5. WordPress will automatically convert markdown formatting:
   - `##` becomes H2 headings
   - `###` becomes H3 headings
   - `**bold**` becomes bold text
   - Bullet lists render correctly

**Step 2: Configure Post Settings** (10 min)

1. **Title**: Copy the H1 title (without the #)
   - Example: "What Is a Legal Billing Partnership? Complete Guide"

2. **Permalink/URL Slug**:
   - Click "Edit" next to permalink
   - Set to: `what-is-legal-billing-partnership`

3. **Category**: Select "Legal Billing Partnerships"

4. **Tags**: Add these tags:
   - legal billing partnership
   - billing outsourcing
   - law firm billing
   - mid-size law firms

5. **Excerpt**: Copy the meta description from the article header

**Step 3: SEO Configuration (Yoast/Rank Math)** (10 min)

Scroll down to the Yoast SEO section at the bottom:

1. **Focus Keyword**: `legal billing partnership`

2. **SEO Title**: Same as article title (or auto-populated)

3. **Meta Description**: Copy from article header
   - Example: "Legal billing partnerships combine US-based expertise with ongoing billing services. Learn how mid-size law firms achieve 3-5x ROI vs in-house or offshore alternatives."

4. **Readability Check**: Review Yoast feedback, fix any red/orange issues

**Step 4: Preview and Publish** (10 min)

1. Click "Preview" button (top right)
   - Review how article looks on the website
   - Check formatting, headings, readability

2. If everything looks good, click "Publish"

3. Visit the live article on your website

4. Test:
   - Does it display correctly?
   - Are headings formatted properly?
   - Do links work?
   - Is it readable on mobile (check on phone)?

**Why**: Successfully uploading one article gives you the process and confidence for the other 19.

---

### **Task 8: Document Your Workflow** (15 minutes)

**Create a simple checklist** for uploading the remaining 19 articles:

```
ARTICLE UPLOAD CHECKLIST

For each article:
[ ] 1. Open markdown file
[ ] 2. Copy content (after meta description)
[ ] 3. Create new WordPress post
[ ] 4. Paste content
[ ] 5. Set title (from H1)
[ ] 6. Set permalink/URL slug (lowercase-with-hyphens)
[ ] 7. Assign category (based on tier)
[ ] 8. Add tags (3-5 relevant keywords)
[ ] 9. Copy excerpt (meta description)
[ ] 10. Configure Yoast SEO:
    - Focus keyword
    - Meta description
    - Review readability
[ ] 11. Preview article
[ ] 12. Publish
[ ] 13. Test live article

Estimated time per article: 20-30 minutes
Total for remaining 19 articles: 6-10 hours
```

**Save this checklist** somewhere accessible (Notes app, Google Doc, etc.)

**Why**: You'll be able to batch-upload articles efficiently without forgetting steps.

---

### **Task 9: Plan Your Upload Schedule** (15 minutes)

**Based on your checkpoint decision**, create a publishing calendar:

**Option A: Rapid Publishing (All 20 in One Week)**
```
Monday (Nov 4): Articles 1-5 (Tier 1 - Category Creation)
Tuesday (Nov 5): Articles 6-10 (Tier 2 - Problem-Solution)
Wednesday (Nov 6): Articles 11-15 (Tier 3 - Technology Expertise)
Thursday (Nov 7): Articles 16-20 (Tier 4 - Thought Leadership)
Friday (Nov 8): Review all articles, fix any issues
```

**Option B: Steady Publishing (1 per Day for 4 Weeks)**
```
Week 1 (Nov 4-8): Articles 1-5 (Tier 1)
Week 2 (Nov 11-15): Articles 6-10 (Tier 2)
Week 3 (Nov 18-22): Articles 11-15 (Tier 3)
Week 4 (Nov 25-29): Articles 16-20 (Tier 4)
```

**Option C: Custom Schedule**
- Create your own based on your availability and priorities

**Add to your calendar** so you remember to publish according to schedule.

**Why**: Publishing consistency helps SEO and gives you a clear execution plan.

## 📊 **11:30 AM - 12:00 PM: Post-Upload Setup**

### **Task 10: Google Search Console Configuration** (20 minutes)

**If you haven't set up Google Search Console yet**:

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Click "Add Property"
3. Enter your website: `https://www.beyondsquareone.com`
4. Verify ownership (usually via HTML file upload or DNS record)
5. Submit sitemap:
   - URL is usually: `https://www.beyondsquareone.com/sitemap.xml`
   - Yoast SEO creates this automatically

**If already set up**:

1. Log in to Google Search Console
2. Go to Sitemaps
3. Submit your sitemap if not already submitted
4. Go to URL Inspection
5. Request indexing for your first published article

**Why**: Google needs to know your content exists before it can rank it.

---

### **Task 11: Set Up Analytics Tracking** (10 minutes)

**Verify Google Analytics is installed**:

1. Visit your website
2. Right-click → View Page Source
3. Search for "gtag" or "analytics.js"
4. If found: ✅ Analytics is installed
5. If not found: Need to install Google Analytics

**Check Analytics Dashboard**:

1. Log in to Google Analytics
2. Go to Real-Time report
3. Visit your website in another browser tab
4. Verify you see your visit in Real-Time report

**Create a bookmark folder** for easy access:
- Google Analytics

- Your BSO website

**Why**: You need to track performance from day one.
